# GameZone 

### GameZone is a full-stack web application built using ASP.NET Core MVC and SQL Server, designed to provide a dynamic platform where users can register, log in, and explore detailed information about various games. The application features secure role-based access control, allowing administrators to manage game records by adding, updating, or deleting entries, as well as assigning roles to specific users through a dedicated admin interface. It includes a built-in search engine and pagination functionality to enhance user experience and make game browsing more efficient. With a focus on clean architecture, responsive UI, and maintainable code, GameZone follows best practices in authentication, authorization, and data management using Entity Framework Core.
